    <tr><th>Application Description</th><td>Same as db description.<br>
      1. Function of FOS to provide the public and industry with notification of fishery openings, closures and ammendments, and public health notices for PSP marine biotoxin closures. All previous notices are available online for public reference.<br>
      2. Module of the Fishery Operations System containing specific screens and code (PL/SQL) for salmon fishery business functions. Contains commercial, economic opportunity, and test fishery catch, effort and biodata<br>
      3. Jason Parsely says not part of FOS. Allows public to sign up to receive fishery notices by email .  Controls sending and storing Fishery notices. FOS FNS allows a notice to be built, the fishery and areas affected identified and then automatically determines which clients to send notices to via email.<br>
      4. Function or module of the Fishery Operations System for automated importing of remote transmitted data via email and interactive importing of data from flat files.<br>
      5. Related to FOS Importer, recieves external emails and inserts data into FOS.</td></tr>

    <tr><th>Decision Supporting Key Products</th><td>In-season and post-season estimates; Price Matched Log Books, Diversification Tables and exploitation rate analysis<br>
      <br>
      Fisher reported catch based on the logbook program. Raw data is collected in-season via a call-centre. QA/QC'd analyzed data is collected and entered post-season directly from the fisher's logbooks. <br>
      <br>
      Commercial Salmon in-season estimates. Produced by fishery managers. Based primarily on the raw in-season fisher reported catch but takes other data sources into account as well such as overflight data and observer data. In-season estimates are entered and stored in FOS from 2005 to the present. <br>
      <br>
      Commercial Salmon post-season estimates. Produced by fishery managers post-season factoring many different data sources. Histrorical estimates from 1996-2004 are stored in FOS.<br> 
      <br>
      Test Fishery salmon catch and bio data. Historical data held from 1955. Data shared with American colleagues as part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty</td></tr>

    <tr><th>Uniqueness</th><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Cost</th><td>10<br>
      We could recover commercial salmon harvest data back to about 2017. It would require staff going through each logbook and re-entering data manually. <br>
      <br>
      Prior to this paper logbooks were only held for 3 years and were then destroyed. Anything prior to 2017 would be permanently lost. </td></tr>
