Operational data is transactional data produced by your organization's day to day operations such as licence ID, catch ID, catch quantity, buyer ID, hails etc. Operational data ususally contains the most up to date information.
Analytical data is used to make business decisions, as opposed to recording the data from actual operational business processes. Examples include grouping catch data from different areas, post season estimates or changes in escapement over time. Analytical Data is best stored in a Data System designed for heavy aggregation or data mining such as a data lake or data warehouse.

1,,Fishery Operations System,"MacKenzie, Julia ; 
Hamilton, Shelee  ",1,,FOS,"The Fishery Operations System (FOS) is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s (DFO) centralized Oracle database that holds commercial salmon fishery catch, effort and biological data. The FOS database was built in 2001 and continues to be the current repository for all data pertaining to DFO’s Pacific Region Commercial Salmon Logbook program.
The Commercial Salmon Logbook program was initiated in 1998 with fleet wide participation made mandatory during the 2001 season. The program requires all commercial salmon fishers to record their daily catch and effort information in a harvest logbook and to subsequently report it to DFO using a service provider within deadlines defined in the conditions of licence. A portion of the information collected from the logbook program contains fisher personal information and is therefore protected and un-releasable.
Fishery Managers use the fisher reported catch and effort, in addition to information collected from other sources such as overflights, to calculate in-season catch estimates.
NOTES: •All catch estimates are reported in pieces (numbers of fish). •Catch estimates include adults and jacks combined.
FOS integrates with the other main systems PLS and QMS. It is used by RM, C&P, Stock assessment, contractors, general public (via internet reports).

Hamilton, Shelee   ",1,Analytical,NuSEDS,"Data entry and analysis of Pacific salmon escapement data. Not published in FGP, Open Government ODI-2016-0015
Salmon escapement data constitute important corporate knowledge which must be adequately maintained and accessible. The Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS) is the DFO Pacific Region’s central database that stores individual spawner survey data records, spawner abundance estimates and the linkages between the two. Annual abundance estimates are maintained by population, as defined by freshwater location and run timing. Each population is referenced to the location of the stream mouth. The watershed-coding system provides unique stream identification and incorporates the natural organization, direction, and hierarchical nature of stream channels and their tributaries.

The NuSEDS database currently reports salmon spawning observations for 9100+ individual populations but escapement estimates (all levels of survey intensity) are available for 9800+ populations.

This database contains historic population data starting in the 1920’s (older data for some rivers exists in other formats). Prior to 1995 a standardized form (BC-16) was used to summarize the estimate of the spawning population size, but the historical database lacked the capacity to describe the number of observations, individual counts or methods used to estimate the abundance of the population. In 1995, responsibility for salmon enumeration was moved to the DFO Science section. At that time, the database was re-written to include descriptive information for each abundance estimate, providing underlying data and the estimation method(s). Many of the historic estimates prior to 1995 are labeled Unspecified Returns because the database was limited to storing one estimate for any given stock. As time and resources permit these data are being replaced with more accurate categorization. With the introduction of the Wild Salmon Policy (2005), individual populations within NuSEDS can now be grouped by Conservation Unit.",1104,No,Production,Oracle database,Structured,DFO Server,Science - FADS,"Suhan, Kayla ","1.
