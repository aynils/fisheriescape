1,,Fishery Operations System,"MacKenzie, Julia
Hamilton, Shelee (SDC)",1,,FOS,"The Fishery Operations System (FOS) is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s (DFO) centralized Oracle database that holds commercial salmon fishery catch, effort and biological data. The FOS database was built in 2001 and continues to be the current repository for all data pertaining to DFO’s Pacific Region Commercial Salmon Logbook program.
The Commercial Salmon Logbook program was initiated in 1998 with fleet wide participation made mandatory during the 2001 season. The program requires all commercial salmon fishers to record their daily catch and effort information in a harvest logbook and to subsequently report it to DFO using a service provider within deadlines defined in the conditions of licence. A portion of the information collected from the logbook program contains fisher personal information and is therefore protected and un-releasable.
Fishery Managers use the fisher reported catch and effort, in addition to information collected from other sources such as overflights, to calculate in-season catch estimates.
NOTES: •All catch estimates are reported in pieces (numbers of fish). •Catch estimates include adults and jacks combined.
FOS integrates with the other main systems PLS and QMS. It is used by RM, C&P, Stock assessment, contractors, general public (via internet reports).

The operational objectives included examining the relative abundance and distribution of pelagic fish in an area where herring have historically aggregated in the summer. 
During 2013-2015, acoustic data were collected along parallel transects in a core survey area off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. The area was bounded inshore by approximately the 50 m isobath and bounded offshore in the south and west by the 200 m isobath (general maximum depth distribution of herring). The northern boundary was based on historical surveys and known distributions of herring. Transect locations were placed from a random starting point and spaced 6 nmi apart. A second set of transects was offset from the first set by half the distance between transects. Data were collected along extra transects north of the core survey area to explore the validity of the northern boundary. 
Acoustic data were collected with a SIMRAD EK60 scientific echo sounder operating at 18 kHz, 38 kHz, and 120 kHz. Acoustic echosign was verified using a midwater trawl net (which was often equipped with net cameras to help identify specific layers in the water column) to collect small representative samples of animals. Trawl net catch per unit effort and catch weight and composition were recorded.  Most catches included herring, hake, and pollock; salmon were present in some catches, but were not commonly caught.  Data from net hauls and catches are held by Jennifer Boldt; acoustic data are held by Stephane Gauthier.

Hamilton, Shelee (SDC) ",1,Analytical,NuSEDS,"Data entry and analysis of Pacific salmon escapement data. Not published in FGP, Open Government ODI-2016-0015
Salmon escapement data constitute important corporate knowledge which must be adequately maintained and accessible. The Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS) is the DFO Pacific Region’s central database that stores individual spawner survey data records, spawner abundance estimates and the linkages between the two. Annual abundance estimates are maintained by population, as defined by freshwater location and run timing. Each population is referenced to the location of the stream mouth. The watershed-coding system provides unique stream identification and incorporates the natural organization, direction, and hierarchical nature of stream channels and their tributaries.

The NuSEDS database currently reports salmon spawning observations for 9100+ individual populations but escapement estimates (all levels of survey intensity) are available for 9800+ populations.

This database contains historic population data starting in the 1920’s (older data for some rivers exists in other formats). Prior to 1995 a standardized form (BC-16) was used to summarize the estimate of the spawning population size, but the historical database lacked the capacity to describe the number of observations, individual counts or methods used to estimate the abundance of the population. In 1995, responsibility for salmon enumeration was moved to the DFO Science section. At that time, the database was re-written to include descriptive information for each abundance estimate, providing underlying data and the estimation method(s). Many of the historic estimates prior to 1995 are labeled Unspecified Returns because the database was limited to storing one estimate for any given stock. As time and resources permit these data are being replaced with more accurate categorization. With the introduction of the Wild Salmon Policy (2005), individual populations within NuSEDS can now be grouped by Conservation Unit.",1104,No,Production,Oracle database,Structured,DFO Server,Science - FADS,Kayla Suhan,"1.

Hamilton, Shelee (SDC, Fishery and Assessment Data)",1,,,"Catch, effort, location (latitude, longitude), relative abundance indices, and associated biological data from groundfish multi-species bottom trawl surveys in West Coast Haida Gwaii. Introduction - The West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) synoptic bottom trawl survey was first conducted annually from 2006 to 2008 and has since been repeated every second year on even numbered years. This survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover the continental shelf and upper slope of most of the British Columbia coast. The other surveys are the Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) survey, the Hecate Strait (HS) survey, the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) survey, and the Strait of Georgia (SOG) survey. The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The survey follows a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Effort - This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch - This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (“trace” amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology - This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass - This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index. The report on the 2012 Strait of Georgia Survey (King et al. 2013) provides an explanation of how the relative indices are derived. Note that we do not calculate a biomass index for the 2014 West Coast Haida Gwaii survey, as this survey was incomplete due to operational problems.",,,,Oracle database,,DFO Server,Ecosystems and Ocean Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Annually,,,,,,,,"Yes, Open Data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assembled productivity (i.e. recruits per spawner) estimates for British Columbian Sockeye, Pink, and Chum Salmon. Annual estimates, by brood year, of spawner numbers, catch, and population and age composition were obtained from regional experts and organized in a simple database. Time series were organized by species and biological or spatial unit (Conservation Unit, Pacific Fisheries Management Area, or aggregates of these). Data quality criteria that delineated three categories of data quality, unique to each data type (spawner, catch, and age structure estimates), were used to rate each data type by return year in each time series, and the overall recruit-per-spawner estimates were rated by brood year. The annual data quality ratings of the component data were then used to rate annual recruit-per-spawner data by species and biological or spatial unit and also to generate global estimates across all years for each time series. These data replace previously published estimates, given our more detailed exploration of temporal changes in both field assessment methods and data quality, where both will serve as a useful starting point to assist analysts with their interpretation of data reliability and results.

The sport fishing community has an important role in the recovery of coded-wire tags found in Coho and Chinook. A coded-wire tag is a 1mm piece of wire that is laser etched with a unique number. Tags are injected into the nose cartilage of juvenile salmon prior to ocean migration. Annually, Canada and the United States tag over 50 million juvenile salmon. Fisheries and Oceans Canada applies about 5.5 million tags, using about 5.5 kilometres of wire. Anglers can recognize the presence of a coded-wire tag because of the missing adipose fin (located on the dorsal surface of the salmon). If you have caught an adipose fin clipped Coho and Chinook, it is a simple matter of removing the head from the fish, completing a sport head label and then submitting the head to a Sport Head Recovery Depot in the area. It is just as important to turn in heads from terminal or freshwater sites as it is from marine areas. Even though anglers fishing close to hatcheries can be fairly certain of the origin of their catch, data will not be recorded unless the heads from fin-clipped recoveries are turned in. Without the data, the health of the stock and the value of the resource to anglers could be underestimated.

46,,Hecate Strait Synoptic Bottom Trawl Survey.,"Haggarty, Dana (Groundfish)
Hamilton, Shelee (SDC, Fishery and Assessment Data)",2,Analytical,,"Catch, effort, location (latitude, longitude), relative abundance indices, and associated biological data from groundfish multi-species bottom trawl surveys in Hecate Strait. Introduction - The Hecate Strait (HS) synoptic bottom trawl survey was first conducted in 2005, and has been repeated every second year since. This survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover the continental shelf and upper slope of most of the British Columbia coast. The other surveys are the Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) survey, the West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) survey, the West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) survey, and the Strait of Georgia (SOG) survey. The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery-independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The surveys follow a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Effort - This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (“trace” amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology - This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass - This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index. The report on the 2012 Strait of Georgia Survey (King et al. 2013) provides an explanation of how the relative indices are derived.",,No,Production,Oracle database CSV,Structured,DFO Server,Ecosystems and Ocean Science,Maria Cornthwaite?,n/a,n/a,see metadata and supporting documents on Open Maps,"open maps, FGP, OBIS",,"stock assessments, provision of scientific advice","science, fisheries management, SARA","stock assessments, science advice",could not perform stock assessments,No,irreplaceable,see size of open maps files,Annually,Yes,No,High,Yes,Unclassified,Comes from groundfish data holdings,No it's a static dataset,"Yes, Open Data, FGP, OBIS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
